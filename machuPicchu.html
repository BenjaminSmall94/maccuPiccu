        <h2>Getting there</h2>
        <p>Your journey starts in the in the high valley and beautiful city of Cusco. Sitting at 11,000 feet 
            above mean sea level, you may want to give yourself a day to acclimate. For the typical day drip 
            to Machu Picchu you will need to wake up early, around 3:50am. You trek will start with a 2 hour 
            van ride to the town of Olla te Tambo. From there you will have the option to catch 3 different
            tiers of trains along a river valley surrounded by mountains in excess of 20,000 ft. The nicest 
            has an entirely glass roof which provides optimal viewing. This will take you to the town of 
            Aguas Calientes. From their it will be another 30 minute van ride to the entrance to Machu Picchu. 
            From the visitor center you can then walk 10 minutes to get your first view of the beautiful lost 
            city of the incas

        <p>As you stand within the complex of Machu Picchu ("Old Mountain" in Quechua) under the shadow of 
            Machu Picchu mountain, you shall also behled the beauty and backdrop of Huayna Picchu ("Young Mountain" 
            in Quechua). You will marvel at the beauty and majesty that was constructed by a civilization 
            without powerful construction tools, so high in the Andes Mountains, bordering the Amazon Jungle

        <p>Just like there were 500 years ago, when the upper class incans inhabited this hidden fortress, 
            llamas grazed the slopes. It's possible their primordial instinctual brains remember what it was
            like when the Incan king would come and visit his special home at this site</p>
        <h2>The Grounds of Machu Picchu</h2>

        <p>It was an awesome an enlightening experience to be able to see the amazing architecture, learn the 
            religious and cultural significance of such a sacred and monumentous place. There were so many 
            beautiful places in Peru, I will definitely go back some day!
